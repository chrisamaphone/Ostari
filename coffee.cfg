Bool = true, false
Unit = unit
Properties:

  expects(asker) = thing
}

askFor(asker: Players, askee: Players, thing: Goods) {
  precondition(B (asker): has(askee, thing) == true);
  tell (askee): Which t in Goods: expects(asker) == t 
}

fulfillOrder(server: Players, customer: Players, good: Goods) {

  precondition has(server, good) == true;
  public (Players) has(server, good) = false;
  public (Players) has(customer, good) = true;

Initial:
has(barista, coffee) = true()
has(barista, tea) = true()

looks like (customer, barista):
